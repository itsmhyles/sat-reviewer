As used in this context, speculates would mean puts forward an idea without firm evidence. The text states that Ochoa doesnt have a definite idea about when humans might need to live in other environments and characterizes Ochoas prediction as a conjecture, or a conclusion presented without convincing evidence.

The landscape outspread below her seemed an enlargement of her present mood, and she found something of herself in its calmness, its breadth, its long free reaches.

If the plants carry out this process of dissolving rock even when the rock already has spaces into which the roots could grow, that would support the researchers hypothesis because it suggests that the plants are getting some advantagesuch as access to phosphorousfrom the action of dissolving rock. If the plants dont benefit from dissolving rock, they would be expected to grow in the cracks that already exist, as doing so would mean that the plants dont have to spend energy creating and secreting acids; if, however, the plants create new entry points by dissolving rock even when cracks already exist, that would support the hypothesis that they depend on dissolving rock for some benefit.",

The text explains that when a person's diaphragm repeatedly contracts and results in hiccups (which may be beneficial for infants), those muscle contractions are 'uncontrollable.'

The text also presents the critics' view as being influenced by a perception that fine artists create works that are 'timeless' and meant for exhibition, whereas fashion designers periodically produce new styles that are meant for purchase.

In the text, Ohiyesa recalls how the women in his tribe harvested maple syrup during his childhood.    Now the women began to test the trees—moving leisurely among them, axe in hand, and striking a single quick blow, to see if the sap would appear. The trees, like people, have their individual characters; some were ready to yield up their life-blood, while others were more reluctant. Now one of the birchen basins was set under each tree, and a hardwood chip driven deep into the cut which the axe had made. From the corners of this chip—at first drop by drop, then more freely—the sap trickled into the little dishes.
